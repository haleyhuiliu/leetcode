- Selection sort
  - Selection sort performs O(N^2) operations regardless of the input.
- Bubble sort
  - Bubble sort could be very quick if given input that is already sorted,
  - and it will take O(N^2) if the output is sorted in reverse.
- Quick sort
  - depending on the implementation could perform O(N^2) operations in the worst case.
- Merge sort
  - always have time complexity O(N*logN) regardless of the input. 
- Heap sort
  - always have time complexity O(N*logN) regardless of the input. 
- Binary search
  - One very important benefit of having sorted elements is the ability of quickly search through them.
  - Can use binary search to find target in the sorted sequence with time complexity O(logN).
